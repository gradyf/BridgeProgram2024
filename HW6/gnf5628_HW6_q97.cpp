/*
Implement a function:
  int printMonthCalender(int numOfDays, int startingDay)
This function is given two parameters:
  numOfDays - The number of days in the month
  startingDay – a number 1-7 that represents the day in the week of the first day
          in that month (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, 3 for Wednesday, etc.).

The function should:
  Print a formatted monthly calendar of that month
     Return a number 1-7 that represents the day in the week of the last day in that
        month

Formatting Notes:
  The output should include a header line with the days’ names.

// b)

/*
 *
 * A method for determining if a year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar system
 * is to check if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
For example, 1896, 1904, and 2000 were leap years but 1900 was not.
Write a function that takes in a year as input and return true if the year is
 a leap year, return false otherwise.

/*
 * c) Implement a function
 * void printYearCalender(int year, int startingDay)
This function is given two parameters:
year – an integer that represents a year (e.g. 2016)
startingDay – a number 1-7 that represents the day in the week of 1/1 in that
year (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, 3 for Wednesday, etc.).
